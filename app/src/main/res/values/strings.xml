			<p align="right">
            Regular assessment and charting of few important physical parameters by the doctor at fixed intervals is called physical health monitoring.
        It includes few simple physical tests such as Blood pressure, pulse monitoring etc. performed by the doctor during your visit and some blood investigations.
        The interval of monitoring (e.g. monthly, weekly etc.) will be decided by your treating doctor and communicated to you.
                Physical health monitoring is an integral part in the management of patients with schizophrenia. </p>
		</item>
        <item>People with schizophrenia have increased rates of physical illness compared with the general population.
        Research has shown that the life expectancy of people with schizophrenia is reduced by 10 years as compared to general population.</item>
        <item>There are several reasons for increased physical health problems:\n
        - Lack of monitoring and assessment of various parameters which can help in early detection of physical problems.\n
        - The health care needs of patients with mental illnesses are sometimes overlooked.\n
        - Patients with schizophrenia are often not able to communicate their physical problems to the doctor clearly.\n
        - Improper dietary habits\n
        - Lack of physical activity\n
        - Disturbances in lifestyle due to schizophrenia (e.g. poor self-care, disturbed sleep etc.)\n
        - Not following treatment regimen properly. (poor adherence)\n
        - Co-morbid substance use disorders (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis) worsens the physical health.\n
        - Side effects of medications
        </item>
        <item>Early detection of physical problems leads to effective management
        It can prevent development of full-blown metabolic disorders such as Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, if corrected early.
        It motivates lifestyle modifications at the earliest which also helps in improvement of physical health
        Side effects of medicines are also detected early.

        <li>Hello! Thanks for connecting with us. I will be sharing with you some basic information about Schizophrenia and how to take care of yourself  when you are living with schizophrenia.</li>
</item>
        <item>
            <li>\u2022 Schizophrenia is a disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.</li> \n <li>\u2022 It manifests usually in late adolescence or early adulthood due to problems in functioning of brain. </li>\n
<li>\u2022 Schizophrenia is also one of the poorly understood illnesses in our society. </li>\n <li>There are various myths associated with Schizophrenia. Evidence gathered from studies and real narratives indicate that the following myths (though prevalent) are not true  </li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li>Schizophrenia is a rare condition.\n
<li>TRUTH: Schizophrenia is not rare; the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is widely accepted to be around 1 in 100. People living with schizophrenia don’t prefer to talk about it due to stigma. This makes the illness seem rare or non-existent. </li>
</li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
        <li>There is no treatment for Schizophrenia. \n
<li>TRUTH: The modern science offers effective treatments for Schizophrenia. Long-term treatment may be required (as it is required in many other illnesses such as Diabetes, hypertension) and when treated properly, many people with schizophrenia are able to enjoy fulfilling, productive lives. </li>
</li>\n
    </item>
        <item>
<li>Patients of schizophrenia cannot lead a healthy and fruitful life. \n
<li>TRUTH: Treatment if started early can lead to decrease in symptoms and improvement in functioning of patients with schizophrenia. There are  interventions that that can help the person lead a more productive and normalized life. </li>
</li>\n
    </item>
        <item>

<li>Patients of schizophrenia get addicted to their medicines\n
<li>TRUTH: Medicines prescribed for schizophrenia are not addictive. If taken properly as prescribed by your  doctor, they can be eventually tapered and stopped. </li>
</li>\n

    </item>
        <item>

<li>The above misconceptions about Schizophrenia are baseless. It is important that we try to challenge these wrong perceptions whenever possible.
Further, you should talk openly with your psychiatrist about any query or concern you may have about Schizophrenia. This will help you to get more factual and scientific information.
</li>\n

    </item>


        <item>
        <li>It takes time to understand the real symptoms associated with Schizophrenia . The common symptoms of the illness that most people may experience are divided in three categories: Positive symptoms, Negative symptoms and Cognitive symptoms. </li>\n
<li>A person may experience symptoms only from one of these categories or some symptoms from all these categories.  The experience of living with Schizophrenia is different for different people.</li>\n
    </item>

        <item>
        <li> Hallucination: Person perceive things that don’t actually exist in the reality. These may include a person hearing voices, seeing things, or smelling things that others can’t hear or see or smell. </li>\n
<li>Delusions: These are false beliefs that don’t change even when the person who holds them is presented with the new/contradicting ideas or facts. People who have delusions often also have problems concentrating, confused thinking, or the sense that their thoughts are blocked.</li>\n
</item>


        <item>
            <li>Helpful tip: Both hallucinations and delusions are symptoms of the illness and continued medication helps in alleviation of these symptoms.</li>\n
    </item>

        <item>


<li>Negative Symptoms are associated with disturbance and disruption in the  normal emotions and behaviours. You may  observe that the
<li>You don’t feel any interest in the day to day activities</li>\n
<li>You don’t feel like interacting much or not at all </li>\n
<li>Doing even basic activities (like brushing teeth, eating meals on time, going out of the house) get difficult </li>\n
</li>\n</item>


        <item>


<li>There are some basic things that can help you if you are experiencing the negative symptoms. Prepare a schedule of daily activities and stick to them. Trying to engage in activities that interest you. Don’t minimize any effort that you are making. Every step counts </li>
        </item>
        <item>
            <li>

Cognitive symptoms include trouble in focussing attention, poor ability to understand the information, difficulty in making decisions about seemingly simple issues, and trouble in implementing the instructions.</li>\n
</item>
        <item>
<li>You can deal with these problems by following these techniques
<li>Follow one activity at a time</li>\n
<li>Break each activity in smaller tasks</li>\n
<li>Seek assistance from someone that you feel comfortable with</li>\n
For instance, you want to learn to cook your favourite meal. If you are a novice cook, You can start with learning to cook a simple dish. First step may be observing someone in family who is cooking your favourite dish, second can be noting down the ingredients required and steps in cooking , third step can be trying the new dish with assistance and  finally you can try out the dish independently. </li>\n
        </item>

        <item>
<li>You may wonder “ Why it happened to me” Schizophrenia is an illness with primarily biological causes.</li>\n

<li>Neurotransmitter Imbalance:  An imbalance of  dopamine, is thought to cause the symptoms of schizophrenia. The medications used for treatment of schizophrenia try to restore the imbalance of neurotransmitters.</li>\n
 </item>
        <item>
<li>Genetics:  Scientists believe that many different genes may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia.</li>\n

<li>There are many people who have schizophrenia who don’t have a family member with the disorder and conversely, many people with one or more family members with the disorder who do not develop it themselves.</li>\n

    </item>
        <item>
        <li>Environmental Factors: Scientists also think that interactions between genes and aspects of the individual’s environment are necessary for schizophrenia to develop. Environmental factors may involve:
            <li>Exposure to viruses </li>                                                                   <li> Malnutrition before birth</li>
            <li> Problems during birth </li>  					      <li>Psychosocial factors </li>

            Their interaction differs from individual to individual and depends to one’s unique biological makeup and psychosocial environment. </li>\n

        </item>
        <item>
        <li>There are numerous factors that lead to development of schizophrenia in an individual. These factors interact in multiple and complex ways so one can’t say what exactly might have caused the illness.  It is important to acknowledge that there is no one single factor or person to be held responsible for the illness.       </li>\n
    </item>

        <item>
        <li>Good news is that we have many effective and proven treatments available to help you</li>\n
        <li>Pharmacological treatment: Antipsychotic medications are usually taken daily in pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotics are injections that are given once or twice a month. Some people have side effects when they start taking medications, but most side effects go away after a few days. \n
            Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination, and the right dose. </li>\n
        </item>
        <item>
        <li>Psychosocial Treatments: These treatments involve learning of specific psychological and social skills by both the patient and their family member to address the everyday challenges of schizophrenia. The current study is about development of mobile based psychosocial treatments that can be delivered from home.</li>\n
        <li>For treatment to be successful, it is important to follow the treatment regimen diligently and follow-up regularly as and when asked by the doctor. </li>\n
    </item>
